## IDEA or PROBLEM STATEMENT
I have submitted a UI design for a mobile microblogging app(as per the theme given) that works on similiar lines to Reddit.
I love Reddit's concept of having cool communitites and subreddits that one can be a part of as well as the factor of staying anonymous and hence free of judgement
The absolute best thing I love is how easy it is to bond with random people about absolutely any and every bizarre interest one might have.
At the same time I feel Reddit can get a bit too non localised i.e since Reddit is not traditionally a platform for uploading personal information and pictures like 
Instagram it might be hard to exclusively share the community feeling with your own bunch of friends on this platform and one get carried away with a community of 
a whole random bunch of virtual strangers with one shared interest.
Hence I have come up with the idea of communi-tea(community for the feeling of belonging and fitting in that an app like reddit provides and tea which is borrowed 
from the phrase spilling the tea as in you can have personalised curations with your own group of friends as well)

What i have added in this app that is different from reddit is I have given more significance to the "followers" section which means you can now not only post to communities
but can also specifically post to your list of followers in addtion to posting something exclusively for your profile and with this idea of followers also comes in the concept
of custom communities --- the objective is that all your friends/followers might not have a common interest for example you know that some of your followers are into 
sports while some are into music and others are into dark memes; so custom communities provides you with the option of sharing posts / microblogs to only one group of followers 
for example you see a music related post so you make sure you share it with only those followers who are interested in this thus creating a smaller knit group amongst your followers , 
furthermore upon creating this custom community you can also decide whether others in this group can share related blogposts with everyone else in this group -- this enables different groups of mutual
friends/followers finding shared interests.
The next change I have introduced is the type of blogposts that one can choose to post also since this is a microblogging app all posts have a cap limit on no. of words and content restrictions unlike
reddit which doesn't set a limit to all its posts. The three types of microblogs one can make are:
  ->posts and comments (largely links and images with text much like instagram posts)--- could be news or memes or a fun video link
  ->forum/discussion thread --- a question or a thought followed by comment discussions and suggestions.
  ->live gamerooms: can post only invites which are destructible after some time -- so this is a relatively new feature that I have chosen to add; live gamerooms is basically
  where someone can post an invitation for a game be it a game of skribbl pictionary or a game of PUB-G, other app users who are online at that time can take part if they're 
  interested; these invites are terminated after soem specified time so users who are online during the time in which the game is being played can join and after the game is finished
  the invite is terminated.

Design : minimalistic approach
On the main profile page I have condensed a short bio, karma points , "reddit age" , followers and following into the main header section of the profile instead
of including a separate about tab for this information.
Instead of having separate tabs on the profile for posts and comments I have created a single tab with a dropbox that you can then choose from to toggle your profile
between these tabs ; in addition to posts and comments i have also added a separate community tab.
I personally found the reddit home page/ feed having posts which seemed condensed and had too much text packed into them - this could make for a visually unattractive
feed especially for first timers not familiar with this styl of blogposts;
To alter this I have arranged the feed into card style posts and clearly demarcated the actual post from other information like community that posted it, user that posted it, upvotes etc.
by using different colors(classic grey and white).
I also ensured some margin space on both sides of the screen for it to look visually "cleaner" and less jammed.
I also tried to reduce the text as much as possible ; I removed text such as "upvotes" and "comments" and instead decided to indicate them with icons that could 
be better in understanding these terms like for a first time user the term upvote could be confusing therefore I indicated this concept with thumbs up and down icons
which could be more simpler to interpret.
furthermore feed settings like sorting posts based on popularity etc is all restricted to a single line of text near the top below the search bar to prevent confusion while
choosing settings for the home page.
